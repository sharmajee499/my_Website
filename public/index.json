People always debate about the Python vs. R. For me, both have advantages in their respective fields. I have used Python and R for about equal amount of time. Personally, I find R to be more powerful in data manipulation, cleaning, summarizing and making statistical models. However, Python is more easy to work when it comes to deep learning and advance computational modeling. Moreover, Python is general purposed programming language meaning, it could be used to make anything. I mean anything like website, computer software, mobile app, API etc.\nHow to Install R ? One basically needs to download two things to get started with R coding i.e. R \u0026amp; R Studio. Think R as a engine whereas R studio as the whole car which supports the engines execution.\n Download R from CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network)  First of all go to this website and download the needed file depending upon your operating system. After you downloaded, install the file and you are all set for first part.\n Download R Studio  No after downloading the R, you are all set to download the R Studio from this. Install the R Studio by opening up the downloaded file. There is nothing wierd setting to be set while installing, go with the flow.\nIf everything goes alright you should be able to set the R environment for you analytical journey.\n","date":1584662400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1584662400,"objectID":"1d8c470a9535ab47b513a359426b1892","permalink":"/post/install_r/","publishdate":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/install_r/","section":"post","summary":"R is a beautiful and powerful programming language.
