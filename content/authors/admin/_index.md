Couples of year ago, I saw the immense capability of **analytics**. So, I decided to make people see the power of data in **decision making** which could be applied to any domain. 

Personally, I am interested in solving **business and organizational** problem through the data-driven approaches. Pointing out as well as excluding **biases** on algorithmic decision making to promote ethics has always been my core value.

Currently, I am on route to develop my knowledge around the data infrastructure solutions and Software Development.
