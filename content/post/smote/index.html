<p>The class imbalance problem is very common scenario that we encounter in
various domains like Churn Analysis in HR, Fraud Analysis in Finance,
Customer Retention in Marketing. Class Imbalance simply means that in
our multi-class target variable the proportion are not equally close to
each other. For instance, in dichotomous classification problem to find
fraudulent transactions our data might have 10 fraudulent transactions
out of 100, which is very common, considering the nature of the problem.
So, in simple terms, there are more observation for one class as
compared to another.</p>
<p>Now, the question is why class imbalance is a problem in data science
and what are its effects? As, we all know, the core working principle of
the any classification algorithm is to find a decision boundary to
separate the two class (I will take binary classification as default in
all part of the blog). The algorithms learn from the data to find the
optimal boundary. When we have more observations on one class, our
algorithms identify the pattern for that majority class but not for the
minority class. Therefore, the algorithms learn various pattern for the
majority class and might perform well for that one. However, on the
other hand, for minority class, it will struggle.</p>
<p>There are various techniques to mitigate the class-imbalance problem.
Some of them are Oversampling, Under-Sampling, Cost-Sensitive
Algorithms, SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Techniques) (Chawla
et al., 2002). In this blog, we will particularly talk about the SMOTE
which is probably one of the widely used techniques in resolving the
class-imbalance problem. I am specifically going to talk about the
procedure, the common mistakes, and pitfalls as well as the right way to
SMOTE.</p>
<p>I will implement all the process in Python. So, let’s get started.</p>
<div id="import-the-libraries" class="section level3">
<h3>Import the Libraries</h3>
<pre class="python"><code>import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from imblearn.datasets import fetch_datasets
from collections import Counter
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
from sklearn.metrics import ConfusionMatrixDisplay
from imblearn.under_sampling import RandomUnderSampler
from imblearn.pipeline import Pipeline</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="load-the-dataset" class="section level3">
<h3>Load the dataset</h3>
<p>In this blog, we will utilize the Abalone Data Set that can be found at
<a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/abalone">this</a> link on UCI
website. It is also pre-attached to the <strong>imblearn</strong> package, so we will
fetch from the api itself.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>
# Get the &#39;Abalone&#39; Data
df = fetch_datasets()[&quot;abalone&quot;]

# Seperate the feature and target
X, y = df.data, df.target

# Count the target-class 
print(Counter(y))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Counter({-1: 3786, 1: 391})</code></pre>
<p>From the above output, you can see that there are two classes [-1,1] and
we can clearly see the imbalance targets.</p>
<p>We will then divided the data into train-test set for validation and
evaluation.</p>
</div>
<div id="train-test-split" class="section level3">
<h3>Train-Test Split</h3>
<pre class="python"><code>X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, train_size=0.8,
                                  stratify=y, random_state=112233)</code></pre>
<p><strong>Pitfall Alert</strong>: One of the common mistakes, we all do is not to
stratify the train and test set. In the balanced dataset, it wouldn’t
matter but in imbalance dataset it will have profound impact. If we
enable the <code>stratify</code> in the <code>train_test_split</code> function, it will keep
the same proportion of the classes in the both train and test set. This
stratification gives the unbiased split for training as well as testing.</p>
<p>Let’s verify that by checking the proportion of the test and train set.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>train_counter = Counter(y_train)
train_prop = [(i, train_counter[i]/len(X_train) * 100) for i in train_counter]
print(f&quot;The train data prop: {train_prop}&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## The train data prop: [(-1, 90.63154744088597), (1, 9.368452559114038)]</code></pre>
<pre class="python"><code>test_counter = Counter(y_test)
test_prop = [(i, test_counter[i]/len(X_test) * 100) for i in test_counter]
print(f&quot;The test data prop: {test_prop}&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## The test data prop: [(-1, 90.66985645933015), (1, 9.330143540669857)]</code></pre>

<div id="logistic-regression-no-smote" class="section level3">
<h3>Logistic Regression (No SMOTE)</h3>
<p>First of all, we will train the model without SMOTE so that we can
compare and contrast the effect of SMOTE on the results. I choose to go
along with Logistic Regression (LR) as it is one of the famous and easy
to understand. However, the purpose of the blog is to compare the result
difference before and after SMOTE, not the modeling algorithm. You can
try with another one to experiment on your own.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>lr_noSmote = LogisticRegression(random_state=112233).fit(X_train, y_train)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="logistic-regression-with-smote" class="section level3">
<h3>Logistic Regression (With SMOTE)</h3>
<div id="smote" class="section level4">
<h4>SMOTE</h4>
<p><strong>Pitfall Alert</strong>: In some of the class project, I have witnessed a
basic problem while performing SMOTE. They applied the SMOTE on the
whole dataset. You should only apply SMOTE after splitting the dataset,
not on the whole raw dataset. Otherwise, we have a problem of the
data-leakage. So, make sure you only apply the SMOTE or any other
sampling techniques to the split train set.</p>
<p>There and various <code>sampling_strategy</code> in the <code>SMOTE</code> function while
oversampling the minority class. I have used the <code>sampling_strategy</code> as
0.3 which means the minority and the majority proportion after smoting
will be the 0.3. Please, refer to the <code>imblearn</code> api for more detailed
explanation on different <code>sampling_strategy</code>. I choose 0.3 arbitrarily
however, for optimal modeling we can tune this parameter and see what
gives us better performance.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>sm = SMOTE(random_state=112233, sampling_strategy=0.3)
X_res, y_res = sm.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)

<h3>Comparing the SMOTE and NON-SMOTE model</h3>
<p>Let’s bring the two models to the battle-ground and see if there is any
improvements. We will use the ROC-AUC score to compare different models.
It is advised for imbalance dataset accuracy is not the right metric as
it can be biased and gave false interpretation.</p>
<pre class="python"><code># No-SMOTE model
y_pred_nosmote = lr_noSmote.predict(X_test)


print(&#39;Accuracy (No Smote): &#39;,lr_noSmote.score(X_test, y_test))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Accuracy (No Smote):  0.9066985645933014</code></pre>
<pre class="python"><code>print(&#39;AUC Score (No Smote): &#39;, roc_auc_score(y_test, y_pred_nosmote))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## AUC Score (No Smote):  0.5</code></pre>
<pre class="python"><code>print(&#39;Confusion Matrix (No Smote): &#39;, &quot;\n&quot;,confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred_nosmote, 
      labels=lr_noSmote.classes_), &#39;\n&#39;)

# SMOTE Model</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Confusion Matrix (No Smote):  
##  [[758   0]
##  [ 78   0]]</code></pre>
<pre class="python"><code>y_pred_smote = lr_smote.predict(X_test)

print(&#39;Accuracy (SMOTE): &#39;,lr_smote.score(X_test, y_test))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Accuracy (SMOTE):  0.8576555023923444</code></pre>
<pre class="python"><code>print(&#39;AUC Score (SMOTE): &#39;,roc_auc_score(y_test, y_pred_smote))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## AUC Score (SMOTE):  0.6167207902036398</code></pre>
<pre class="python"><code>print(&#39;Confusion Matrix (SMOTE): &#39;, &quot;\n&quot;, confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred_smote, 
      labels=lr_smote.classes_))
</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Confusion Matrix (SMOTE):  
##  [[692  66]
##  [ 53  25]]</code></pre>
<p>From the above comparison, we can clearly see that the model where SMOTE
is applied performed better then the without SMOTE one. We have
increased the AUC score as well as we have also correctly classified
more number of minority class. In the plain data, we correctly
classified the majority class but our model couldn’t separate any of the
minority class. On the other hand, the SMOTED model, was able to
separate 25 minority class in expense of majority class errors.</p>
<p><strong>Pitfall Alert</strong>: Don’t compare the model performance with accuracy
metric for the imbalanced dataset. Our SMOTED model’s accuracy has
decreased but that doesn’t mean the model isn’t better then the plain
model. Let’s take the same example of the our fraudulent detection. If
we implement plain model like above we identified all the non-fraudulent
activity but none of the fraudulent activity. Does that solve our main
problem which is to identify fraudulent activity? Absolutely No.
However, the SMOTED model is able to identify more fraudulent activity
as compared to plain one. So, which model will you choose for
production? I am sure you all are deviated towards the SMOTED one.</p>
<p>Now, will you be surprised if I tell you that is not the right way to
SMOTE? Then, get ready to be surprised.</p>

<div id="smote-the-right-way" class="section level3">
<h3>SMOTE: The Right Way</h3>
<p>In the original paper by Chawla et.al (2002), they performed their
comparision by combining oversampling with SMOTE and then under-sampling
the majority class. However, in many of the paper and projects, what I
have seen is that most of them have only used over-sample with SMOTE but
haven’t done under-sample.</p>
<p>In the below also, the over-sampling strategy remains the same - 0.3. In
the under-sample, I choose the strategy to be 0.5 meaning, the ratio of
majority and minority will be 0.5. Our new mixed method will have fewer
data-points then the SMOTED model because we under-sampled after the
SMOTE.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>
# Over-Sample
os = SMOTE(random_state=112233, sampling_strategy=0.3)

# Under-Sample
us = RandomUnderSampler(random_state=112233, sampling_strategy=0.5)

# Pipeline
pipe = Pipeline(steps = [(&#39;over&#39;, os), (&#39;u&#39;, us)])

# New train Dataset
X_mix, y_mix = pipe.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)

# Count of the new data
print(Counter(y_mix))

# Modeling</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Counter({-1: 1816, 1: 908})</code></pre>
<pre class="python"><code>lr_mix = LogisticRegression(random_state=112233).fit(X_mix, y_mix)

# Prediction
y_pred_mix = lr_mix.predict(X_test)

# Metrices
print(&#39;Accuracy: &#39;,lr_mix.score(X_test, y_test))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Accuracy:  0.812200956937799</code></pre>
<pre class="python"><code>print(&#39;AUC Score: &#39;,roc_auc_score(y_test, y_pred_mix))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## AUC Score:  0.7181685948176714</code></pre>
<pre class="python"><code>print(&#39;Confusion Matrix: &#39;,&quot;\n&quot;,confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred_mix, labels=lr_mix.classes_))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Confusion Matrix:  
##  [[632 126]
##  [ 31  47]]</code></pre>
<p>Below is the table that compare the plain, smoted and mixed model
result:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="36%" />
<col width="18%" />
<col width="45%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Model</th>
<th>AUC Score</th>
<th>Correctly Classified Minority Class</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Plain</td>
<td>0.5</td>
<td>0/78</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>SMOTE only</td>
<td>0.61</td>
<td>25/78</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>SMOTE + Under-Sample</td>
<td>0.81</td>
<td>47/78</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As you can see from the result, our dataset is decreased. However, with
this fewer data points also, we have substantial increased the AUC
score. The model was able to classify more minority class. So, it is
clear that over-sample with SMOTE followed by under-sample performs
better. I want to reiterate that the test data are same across all the
models that we compared. So, why this works? I am copying the answer
from the original paper, <em>“Our method of synthetic over-sampling works
to cause the classifier to build larger decision regions that contain
nearby minority class points.”</em>.</p>

<h3>Final Notes</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Extension of the SMOTE</li>
</ol>
<p>There are various extension of SMOTE that works on the variety of
dataset. For the dataset containing mix of categorical and numeric
variable there is SMOTE-NC. I would suggest to look at the <code>imblearn</code>
official API for more variety and apply the extension that fits your
scenario.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>SMOTE in Real-World Application</li>
</ol>
<p>In the recent paper by Tarawneh et al.(2022), they empirically showed
that the variety of over-sampling techniques including SMOTE and it’s
extensions, are deceptive and could lead to severe failure in real-world
application. They found that, when the datasets were changed it produced
intolerable number of errors.</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Is SMOTE needed?</li>
</ol>
<p>One study by Elor &amp; Averbuch-Elor (2022) demonstrated that balancing
with SMOTE could be beneficial for the weak classifier but not for the
strong ones. This means, we might see some improvements in the results
with SMOTE if applied to simpler algorithms like Logistic Regression,
Decision Tree, Naive Bayes but we might not see those improvement if
ensemble or complex algorithms like Catboost, XGBoost etc are used. In
their experiment, the Catboost without balancing outperformed the
balanced one.</p>
<p>So, should we use SMOTE? The answer is, “it depends”. As answer to many
Data Science question, we have to experiment and see how it reacts to
our scenario. Experiment with different methods and see what gives you
optimal result.</p>
