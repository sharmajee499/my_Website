<p><strong>R</strong> is a beautiful and powerful programming language. People always
debate about the Python vs. R. For me, both have advantages in their
respective fields. I have used Python and R for about equal amount of
time. Personally, I find R to be more powerful in data manipulation,
cleaning, summarizing and making statistical models. However, Python is
more easy to work when it comes to deep learning and advance
computational modeling. Moreover, Python is general purposed programming
language meaning, it could be used to make anything. I mean anything
like website, computer software, mobile app, API etc.</p>

<h3>How to Install R ?</h3>
<p>One basically needs to download two things to get started with R coding
i.e. R &amp; R Studio. Think R as a engine whereas R studio as the whole car
which supports the engines execution.</p>
