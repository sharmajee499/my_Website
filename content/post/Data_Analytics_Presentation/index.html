<p>Recently, I was invited by couples of faculty member from Nicholls State Universityâ€™s College of Business to present about the Data Analytics. The presentation was all about data analytics future, job demand, scope and resources available at College of Business. I want to thank <a href="https://cmcastille.netlify.app/" target="_blank">Dr.Â Chris Castille</a> for arranging this opportunity. I have already given 6 presentation in the various classes like Computer Information System [CIS_231], Business Statistics [QBA_282/283], Management [MNGT_301], Marketing [MKTG_470] and Business Administration [BSAD_101]. I still have two more presentation to give which is on mid-April.</p>
<p>The video of one of my presentation given on MKTG_470 can be found on this <a href="https://youtu.be/6E7b6CPwx9s" target="&quot;_blank">link</a></p>

<p>I am sorry for the audio quality of the video. I should have presented nearby the mic. There are plenty of mistakes as I was nervous as well as excited. At the end, I would like to thank the respective faculties who gave me a chance to present in their classes. In addition, I would also expand my gratitude towards the students who listened my presentation for 45 minutes. ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
