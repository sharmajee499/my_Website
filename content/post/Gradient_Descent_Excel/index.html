<p>In my last post, I described the math behind the Gradient Descent. In there, I explained about the definition, working principles and how does it works in terms of Multiple Linear Regression. You can check out the article through this <a href="https://sharmajee499.netlify.app/post/gradient_multiple_regression/" target="_blank">link</a></p>
<p>In this video, <strong>which can be accessed via this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hYMuQXCj8c" target="_blank">link</a></strong>, I explained how the Gradient Descent works in order to solve the Multiple Regression Problem.</p>
